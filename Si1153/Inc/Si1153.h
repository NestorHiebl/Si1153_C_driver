/* @file Si1153.h
 * The SI1153 has two register sets. The I²C registers are directly accessible to the host/user and can be
 * read and written to directly, using the I²C interface. The second set of registers is the parameter table,
 * which is only indirectly accessible to the host. To read and write to the parameter table, one must make
 * use of the "COMMAND" I²C register. Writing a valid command code to the "COMMAND" register causes the
 * sensor to perform a corresponding operation. After every write to the "COMMAND" register, the "RESPONSE0"
 * register should be read and its contents examined, as it reports errors as well as increments every time
 * a command has been successfully executed. One of the main uses of the "COMMAND" register is to configure
 * the SI1153. This is accomplished by writing a byte into the "HOSTIN0" I²C register, and then writing the
 * "PARAM_SET" command into the "COMMAND" register. A successful execution of "PARAM_SET" causes the
 * written byte to be copied into the "RESPONSE1" I²C register.*/
